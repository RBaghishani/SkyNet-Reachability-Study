\section{Results and Discussion}

\subsection{Reachability Network Analysis}

In the reachability network analysis, we calculated essential network metrics for the United States and Canada reachability networks. These metrics included betweenness centrality, PageRank, clustering coefficient, degree centrality, and average neighbor degree. The results revealed important insights into the structure and properties of the reachability networks in both countries.

\subsection{Comparison of US and Canada Networks}

When comparing the reachability networks of the United States and Canada, we observed some interesting differences. The degree centrality analysis highlighted nodes with the highest number of connections, indicating key transportation hubs in each country. We found that major cities such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, Las Vegas, Montreal, and Calgary had high degree centrality in their respective networks, suggesting their significance in terms of reachability.

Examining the betweenness centrality metric provided insights into the nodes that acted as crucial bridges or connectors between different parts of the network. In the United States, cities like Chicago, Atlanta, and Dallas exhibited high betweenness centrality, indicating their importance in facilitating travel between different regions. Similarly, in Canada, cities like Calgary and Montreal showed high betweenness centrality, indicating their role as key connectors within the reachability network.

We also evaluated the clustering coefficient, which measures the extent of clustering or local connectivity within the network. Higher clustering coefficients indicate that nodes tend to form tightly connected groups or communities. In both the United States and Canada reachability networks, we found higher clustering coefficients in certain regions, suggesting the presence of local transportation networks or regional hubs.

Furthermore, analyzing the PageRank metric allowed us to identify nodes with high influence or importance in the reachability networks. Nodes with high PageRank scores indicated their significance in terms of their ability to reach other important nodes within the network. We found that major transportation hubs like airports and major cities had higher PageRank scores, emphasizing their centrality in terms of reachability.
